	<h1>ROllertest Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>This is the privacy policy for ROllerozxa's ROllertest (package name se.voxelmanip.rollertest). The app source code is available <a href="https://github.com/rollerozxa/rollertest">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>What Information is collected</h2>
	<p>By default the app makes connections to the following services:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Minetest ContentDB (content.minetest.net): The app connects to ContentDB when fetching mods from the main menu content browser.</li>
		<li>The Minetest Serverlist (servers.minetest.net): When you go onto the "Join Game" tab, the current list of servers is fetched from the Minetest Serverlist.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When a request is sent, the following is logged in "access logs":</p>

	<ol>
		<li>IP address</li>
		<li>timestamp</li>
		<li>page URL, and</li>
		<li>response status code.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When you connect to a third-party multiplayer server, the server owner may log additional data under a different policy. Please be sure to read the privacy policy of the given multiplayer server before connecting.</p>

	<h2>How this is information used</h2>
	<p>The access logs are used for maintenance, debugging and to detect and mitigate potential attacks.</p>

	<h2>Who has access to this information</h2>
	<p>Only the administrator of the given service has access to the access log. Excerpts may be shared with other developers or staff members to aid with debugging.</p>

	<h2>Retention</h2>
	<p>The access logs will be deleted within a few weeks as log rotation deletes the oldest logs after a given time.</p>
